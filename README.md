**Empowering Animal Shelters Through Fun and Technology**

## üìú Overview
**Milo** is an innovative app designed to address the challenges faced by shelter animals. Many animals are euthanized due to a lack of resources, but **Milo** provides a solution by allowing users to support these shelters indirectly through interactive and enjoyable games.

By playing games, watching ads, and accumulating **MiloCoins**, users can help fund shelter needs (1,000 MiloCoins = 1 euro). Additionally, the app promotes pet adoption by featuring detailed profiles of animals in need of homes, and it integrates AI to provide personalized health advice for pets.

## üê± Why Milo?
The Milo app was born out of a passion for animal welfare. We noticed that many shelters struggle with insufficient resources, preventing them from providing stable homes for animals. As animal lovers, we wanted to create an impactful solution that seamlessly integrates technology with compassion.

**Our Mission:**  
To create a sustainable and scalable platform that not only benefits pets but also provides users with a fun and meaningful experience. Every game played and ad watched contributes to improving the lives of shelter animals, ensuring they have the care they deserve.
